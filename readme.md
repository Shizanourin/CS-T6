# Cyber Security Internship - Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation

## üéØ Objective

This project fulfills Task 6 of the Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship, which required the creation and evaluation of password strength to understand best practices and common security risks.

## üß™ Methodology

The evaluation was conducted by creating multiple passwords with varying complexity and length (including simple, complex, and passphrase examples). Each password was tested using a free online password strength checker (e.g., `passwordmeter.com` or similar tools) to record the strength score, estimated cracking time, and specific feedback.

Key concepts like Brute Force and Dictionary attacks were researched to understand how password complexity affects real-world security.

## üìä Deliverables

The primary deliverable is the detailed **Report.pdf** (or **Report.md**) which includes:

1.  **Tested Passwords:** The three examples used for testing (simulated in the report for security).
2.  **Strength Results:** Scores and feedback for each password.
3.  **Key Findings:** A summary of best practices for strong password creation.
4.  **Security Research:** Summaries of common password attacks (Brute Force, Dictionary) and the importance of complexity.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

* **`Task_6_Password_Report.pdf`** or **`Task_6_Password_Report.md`**: The main evaluation report with results and analysis.
* **`Screenshots/`**: A folder containing screenshots of the strength checker results for the tested passwords (or simulated screenshots).

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

The evaluation reinforced that:

* **Length is paramount:** Passphrases (15+ characters) offer vastly superior security compared to complex, shorter passwords.
* **Complexity is crucial:** Combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols significantly increases the time required for a brute-force attack.
* **Avoid common words/patterns:** Dictionary attacks exploit the use of personal information or simple word substitutions.
