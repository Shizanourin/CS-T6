# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

**Internship:** Cyber Security Internship (Elevate Labs) 

**Task Objective:** To understand the components of a strong password and evaluate its strength using online tools.

**Tool Used:** Online free password strength checker (Simulated results based on common algorithms like Zxcvbn, similar to passwordmeter.com ).

## Part 1: Password Creation and Strength Evaluation

The evaluation involved creating three passwords with varying levels of complexity to test the impact of length, character variety, and common patterns.

| Test Password             | Characters Used                      | Length | Purpose of Test                                  | Strength Score (Simulated) | Time to Crack (Simulated) | Tool Feedback / Rating                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `password123`             | Lowercase, Numbers                   | 11     | Testing an extremely common and weak password.   | Very Weak (5/100)          | Instantly                 | Feedback: Extremely common. Contains a dictionary word and sequential numbers.      |
| `P@sswOrd!2025`           | Mixed case, Numbers, Symbols         | 13     | Testing a password with common word substitutions. | Fair (65/100)              | Hours to Days             | Feedback: Good character mix, but uses a common dictionary word with simple substitutions. |
| `TheGreenDuckFlew@37!`    | Passphrase: Mixed case, Numbers, Symbols | 21     | Testing a long, unique passphrase.               | Excellent (100/100)        | Trillions of Years        | Feedback: Exceptional length and variety. Highly secure against all current attacks. |

## Part 2: Analysis and Best Practices

### A. Identification of Best Practices for Strong Password Creation

Based on the evaluation, strong passwords should use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, and prioritize length variations.

* **Prioritize Length:** Passwords should be long, ideally 15 characters or more. This is the single most effective way to increase security.
* **Use Passphrases:** Create a memorable, unique sentence or string of unrelated words that is easy for you to remember but hard for a computer to guess.
* **Mix Character Types:** A strong password must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Avoid Predictable Patterns:** Do not use personal information, common dictionary words, or sequential numbers/letters, as these are highly susceptible to dictionary attacks.
* **Use Password Managers:** Utilize password managers to generate and securely store unique passwords for every account.

### B. Tips Learned from the Evaluation

* **Common patterns fail quickly:** Passwords based on simple dictionary words or recognizable patterns are cracked quickly, confirming a common mistake in password creation.
* **The Power of Passphrases:** A strong passphrase (a longer string of words) is drastically more secure than a short, complex password.
* **Complexity Affects Security:** Increased password complexity (length and character variety) exponentially increases the time required to crack the password, summarized as its impact on security.

## Part 3: Research on Password Attacks and Security Concepts

### Common Password Attacks

* **Brute Force Attack:** This involves an attacker systematically trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until the correct password is found.
* **Dictionary Attack:** The attacker uses a pre-compiled list (dictionary) of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords to try and gain access.

### Impact of Password Complexity on Security

* **Keyspace:** Complexity, especially password length, exponentially increases the keyspace (the total number of possible combinations).
* **Time Cost:** A larger keyspace means that a brute-force attack takes significantly more computational time, moving the time-to-crack from seconds to years or centuries, making the attack impractical.
* **Defense against Dictionary Attacks:** Unique, long passphrases that avoid common words are not found in the dictionary files used by dictionary attacks.

### Other Key Security Concepts

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** A security process that requires a user to present two or more verification factors (e.g., password + one-time code) to gain access.
* **Password Manager:** A software application that stores and manages user's passwords in an encrypted database, helping users maintain unique, strong passwords for every account.
